# Euler Decode

The goal of this project **Euler Decode** is to help people in solving mathematical challenges, mainly focused on solving [Project Euler's](https://projecteuler.net/) challenges, with my way of approach to these challenges.

**Programming Language** used to solve the challenges : **Python**


This repository hosts the website as well as the content of the Euler Decode, published at [https://eulerdecode.netlify.app/](https://eulerdecode.netlify.app/). All content can be found in the **_post** folder.

We'd also like to collaborate on the tutorial with other people.

Something's wrong? Mistake it in Solution? Explain it to people or Correct it for people, and add as PR üëè
