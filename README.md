# Euler Decode

The goal of this project **Euler Decode** is to help peoples in solving mathematical challenges, mainly focuced on solving [Project Euler's](https://projecteuler.net/) challenges, with my way of approach to this challenges.

**Programming Language** used to solve the challenges : **Python**


This repository hosts the website as well as the content of the Euler Decode, published at [https://eulerdecode.ayanbag.com](https://eulerdecode.ayanbag.com). All content can be found in **_post** folder.
