### Problem Statement

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$
1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385
$$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$
(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025
$$

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

### Solution

```
n=100
sum100 = (n *(n+1)*(2*n+1))/6

sumsq=(n*(n+1))/2

print((sumsq)**2-sum100)
```

**Output**

```
25164150
