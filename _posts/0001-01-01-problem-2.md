### Problem Statement 


Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

$$
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution

```
n1, n2 = 1, 2
nth=0
l=[]
while n1 < 4*10**6:
    nth = n1 + n2
    if n1%2==0:
        l.append(n1)
    n1 = n2
    n2 = nth

print(sum(l))
```

**Output**
