### Problem Statement

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.


**37** 36 35 34 33 32 **31** <br>
38 **17** 16 15 14 **13** 30 <br>
39 18  **5**  4  **3** 12 29 <br>
40 19  6  1  2 11 28 <br>
41 20  **7**  8  9 10 27 <br>
42 21 22 23 24 25 26 <br>
**43** 44 45 46 47 48 49 <br>

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

### Solution

```
def is_prime(n):
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True


i = 0

gap = 1
ratio = 1
primes = []
all_numbers = [1]

while ratio > 0.1:
    for j in range(4):
        i += gap
        present_number = 2*i + 1
        all_numbers.append(present_number)
        if is_prime(present_number):
            primes.append(2*i + 1)
    ratio = float(len(primes))/len(all_numbers)
    gap += 1

print (int((2*i+1)**0.5))
```

**Output**

```
26241
```
