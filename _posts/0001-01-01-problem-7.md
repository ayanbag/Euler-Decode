## Problem Statement

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10 001st prime number?

## Solution

```
def isPrime(n):
    if n < 2: return "Neither prime, nor composite"
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nthPrime(n):
    numberOfPrimes = 0
    prime = 1

    while numberOfPrimes < n:
        prime += 1
        if isPrime(prime):
            numberOfPrimes += 1
    return prime

print(nthPrime(10001))
```

**Output**

```
104743
```
