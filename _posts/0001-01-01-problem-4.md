### Problem Statement

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### Solution

```
pro=1
temp=""
palin = []
for i in range(101,1000):
    for j in range(101,1000):
        pro= i*j
        temp=str(pro)
        if temp == temp[::-1]:
            palin.append(int(temp))

print(max(palin))
```

**Output**

```
906609
