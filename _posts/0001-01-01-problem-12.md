### Problem Statement

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

$$

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:


1: 1 <br/>
3: 1,3 <br/>
6: 1,2,3,6 <br/>
10: 1,2,5,10 <br/>
15: 1,3,5,15 <br/>
21: 1,3,7,21 <br/>
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28 <br/>


We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

### Solution

```
i=1
lt=[]
nd=0
div=dict()
def factors(x):
    result = []
    i = 1
    while i*i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            result.append(i)
            if x//i != i: 
                result.append(x//i)
        i += 1
    return result
bol=True
while bol:
    lt.append(i)
    su=sum(lt)
    if(len(factors(su))>500):
        print(su)
        bol=False
        break
    i=i+1
```

**Output**

```
76576500
```
