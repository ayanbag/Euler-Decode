### Problem Statement

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, $$a < b < c$$, for which,

$$

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

$$

For example, $$32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52$$.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which 

$$
a+b+c=1000
$$

Find the product $$abc$$.

## Solution

```
for a in range(1,1000):
    for b in range(a+1,1000):
        c=1000-a-b
        if (a*a+b*b)==c*c:
            print (a*b*c) 
```

**Output**

```
31875000
```
