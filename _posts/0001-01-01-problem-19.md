### Problem Statement

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September, April, June and November. All the rest have thirty-one, Saving February alone, Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine. And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.



How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?


### Solution

```
from datetime import *

counter = 0
year = 1901
month = 1

curr_day = date(year,month,1)

while(curr_day.year < 2001):
	if(curr_day.weekday() == 6):
		counter += 1
	if(month+1 == 13):
		month = 1
		year += 1
	else:
		month += 1
	curr_day = date(year,month,1)

print(str(counter))
```

**Output**

```
171
```
