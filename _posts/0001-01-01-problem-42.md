### Problem Statement

The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using [words.txt](https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p042_words.txt), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?


### Solution

```
name=[]
with open('words.txt','r') as file: 
    for line in file: 
        for word in line.split(','): 
            word=word.strip('"')
            name.append(word) 


val=dict()
temp=1
for i in range(65,91):
    val[chr(i)] = temp
    temp+=1

def tvalue():
    val1=[]
    for n in range(1,26*10):
        tmp=int((n+1)*n*0.5)
        val1.append(tmp)
    return val1
t=tvalue()

count=0
for i in name:
    s=0
    for j in i:
        s=s+val[j]
    if s in t:
        count=count+1

print(count)
```

**Output**

```
162
```
