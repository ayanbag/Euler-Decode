### Problem Statement

The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.

What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?


### Solution

```
from itertools import permutations


def sieve(n):
    is_prime = [True]*n
    is_prime[0] = False
    is_prime[1] = False
    is_prime[2] = True
    for i in range(3,int(n**0.5+1),2):
        index = i*2
        while index < n:
            is_prime[index] = False
            index = index+i
    prime = [2]
    for i in range(3,n,2):
        if is_prime[i]:
            prime.append(i)
    return prime

prime=sieve(10000)
primes = [x for x in prime if x > 1487]

def create(b):
    for i in range(len(b)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(b)):
            difference = b[j] - b[i]
            if b[j] + difference in b:
                return str(b[i])+str(b[j])+str(b[j]+difference)
    return False

for i in primes:
    p = permutations(str(i))
    a = [int(''.join(x)) for x in p]
    a = list(set([x for x in a if x in primes]))
    a.sort()
    if len(a) >= 3:
        if create(a):
            print (create(a))
            break
```

**Output**
