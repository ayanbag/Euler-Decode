### Problem Statement

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 1<sup>4</sup> + 6<sup>4</sup> + 3<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> \\
8208 = 8<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 0<sup>4</sup> + 8<sup>4</sup> \\
9474 = 9<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> \\
As 1 = 1<sup>4</sup> is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.


### Solution

```
final=[]
for a in range(2,355000):
    s=list(str(a))
    temp=0
    for i in s:
        temp=temp+int(i)**5
    if temp==a:
        final.append(temp)
    
print(sum(final))
```

**Output**

```
443839
```
