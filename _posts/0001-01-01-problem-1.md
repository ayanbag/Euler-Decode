### Problem Statement 

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Solution 

```
l = []

for i in range(1,1000):
    if i%3 == 0:
        l.append(i)

    elif i%5 == 0:
        l.append(i)
    else:
        continue

print(sum(l))
```

**Output** 

```
233168
```
