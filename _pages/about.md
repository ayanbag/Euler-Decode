title: About This Project

The goal of this project **Euler Decode** is to help peoples in solving mathematical challenges, mainly focuced on solving [Project Euler's](https://projecteuler.net/) challenges, with my way of approach to this challenges.



### Why do you post the solutions?

This is an often asked question, since some feel that it is cheating to read solutions on the web. However , we do it since many of the problems can be solved the brute force, or it can be solved by smarter means. We seek these smarter means whenever we can. So we post the solutions both in order to learn even more our self, but also to inspire others to delve into more computer science.

To be honest you can find the solutions for most of the problems online already, some of them without an explanation and some of them with. So if you want to cheat, you can easily do so. We hope that you use the solutions as an inspiration to improve your problem solving skills once you have conquered the problems yourself.

### Bug or typo or mistake in code? 

Please write at our [github](https://github.com/ayanbag/Euler-Decode). I want to make this open-source project available for people all around the world.
