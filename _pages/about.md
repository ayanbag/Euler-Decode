title: About This Project
---

The goal of this project **Euler Decode** is to increase our own (and the readers) knowledge and get YOU interested in computer science while having fun at the same time. I know that this is a very difficult goal but I hope you do enjoy. The focus is mainly on solving [Project Euler's](https://projecteuler.net/) challenges out there. 


### Why do you post the solutions?

This is an often asked question, since some feel that it is cheating to read solutions on the web. However , we do it since many of the problems can be solved the brute force, or it can be solved by smarter means. We seek these smarter means whenever we can. So we post the solutions both in order to learn even more our self, but also to inspire others to delve into more computer science.

To be honest you can find the solutions for most of the problems online already, some of them without an explanation and some of them with. So if you want to cheat, you can easily do so. We hope that you use the solutions as an inspiration to improve your problem solving skills once you have conquered the problems yourself.

### Bug or typo? Great idea? 

Please write at our [github](https://github.com/ayanbag/Euler-Decode). I want to make this open-source project available for people all around the world.
